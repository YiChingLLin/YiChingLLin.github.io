<!-- <br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning
methods for speech and language tasks. I am currently working on <b>speech recognition</b> and <b>speaker
	diarization</b> for multi-talker recordings. I am generously funded by an <a
	href="https://ai2ai.engineering.jhu.edu/2022-2023-ai2ai-fellows/">AI2AI fellowship</a> for 2022-23.<br><br>

I have interned in the speech groups at Microsoft (in 2021) and Meta (in 2022). Previously,
I graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2017 with a major in Computer Science.<br><br> -->
