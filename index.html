<br>Hello, I'm Yi Ching Lin from Taiwan. I hold a master's in Management Information Systems (Technological series) from National Chengchi University. 
Throughout my graduate studies, I was a member of the Software Security Laboratory, where my research is focused on  <b>Explainable AI</b>. 
I've also worked as a Teaching Assistant for Data Structure and as a Research Assistant conducting AI research. 
In addition, my internships equipped me with hands-on experience in customized software and software design and development. 
Aspiring to evolve into a  <b>professional software engineer</b>, I am eager to embrace new challenges and be open to international opportunities.<br><br>
